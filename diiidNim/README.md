# diiidNim
A collection of python scripts that are useful for simulations of DIII-D experiments.

## iCoilWallUtil
This script is used to generate a new DIII-D "wall", such that all the points are inside the i-coils.

## startPositions
This script is used to seed a bunch of NIMFL start positions that lie inside the NIMRODs DIII-D computational domain.

### Todo
 - [ ] Documents scripts
 - [ ] Clean up code
 - [ ] Convert to python 3
 - [ ] Add more scripts from work computer
