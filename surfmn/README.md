# surfmnScan

A utility for analyzing a bunch of surfmn plots and making pretty pictures

To start I will want to look over a bunch of directors in the present working
directory, plot the data, get the time step, and find psi at the rational 
surface.

In the future I might tie this into nimpy and do the surfmn analysis
